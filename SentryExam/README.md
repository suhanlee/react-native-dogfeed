## Android
## ios (CocosPods)
If you see message while building ios project like below
```
#import "RNSentry.h" // This is used for versions of react < 0.40
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
```
Maybe installing pod modules is failed.
So you should install pod modules correctly.
```
$ cd ios
$ pod install
```
and If you see error message like below
```
[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "Sentry":
  In Podfile:
    SentryReactNative (from `../node_modules/react-native-sentry`) was resolved to 0.37.0, which depends on
      Sentry (~> 3.12.4)
```
update cocoapods and re-install it.
```
$ pod repo update
$ pod install
```
